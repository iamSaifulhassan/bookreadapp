This is a sample text file for testing the book content screen.

This sentence demonstrates the text-to-speech functionality. Each sentence should be highlighted when being read aloud.

The rolling text buffer should show the previous, current, and next sentences. This helps users follow along with the reading.

Text files are fully supported with sentence navigation and TTS controls. Users can click on any sentence to jump to that position.

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes. All file operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks for safety.

This is the end of the sample text file. Thank you for testing the new book content screen functionality!
