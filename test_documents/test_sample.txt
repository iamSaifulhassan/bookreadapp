This is a sample text file for testing the TheBookRead app. 

This file contains multiple sentences to test the text-to-speech functionality and the rolling text buffer feature. Each sentence should be properly detected and can be read aloud using the TTS controls.

The app should display this text content clearly. Users can navigate between sentences using the previous and next buttons. The current sentence should be highlighted when reading.

The rolling text buffer shows three sentences at once: the previous sentence, the current sentence being read, and the next sentence that will be read. This helps users follow along with the reading.

The TTS controls include play, pause, stop, previous sentence, and next sentence buttons. All controls should be responsive and work correctly with both PDF and text files.

This is the final sentence in our test file. When the TTS reaches this sentence and finishes reading it, the playback should stop automatically.
