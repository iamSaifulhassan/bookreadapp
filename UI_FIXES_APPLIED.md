# 🔧 UI Fixes Applied - Profile Text Color & Editability

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **White Text Color Issue in Edit Profile**
**Problem**: Text in CustomTextField was white/invisible on light backgrounds
**Solution**: 
- Updated `AppColors.dart` text colors from white to proper dark colors
- Enhanced `CustomTextField` with better color handling
- Added read-only state styling

**Changes Made**:
```dart
// AppColors.dart - Fixed text colors
textPrimary = Color(0xFF212121)    // Dark grey (was white)
textSecondary = Color(0xFF757575)  // Medium grey (was white70)
```

### 2. **Profile Screen Fields Were Editable**
**Problem**: Profile screen fields were editable when they should be read-only
**Solution**: 
- Added `readOnly` parameter to `CustomTextField`
- Set all profile screen fields to `readOnly: true`
- Added visual styling for read-only state

**Changes Made**:
```dart
// Profile Screen - All fields now read-only
CustomTextField(
  // ...existing properties...
  readOnly: true,  // ← Added this
)
```
